The detailed explanation to the project can be found in the "Medicine Data Analysis.ppsx" file.

The "Final Medicine Result.csv" file contains the result data that is used for deployment purpose.
The deployment is done using Flask.

To run the Resultant Webpage i.e "home.html" file present in the template folder one has to run the python terminal and run the "main.py" python program. (All the files have to be in a single directory for the program to run correctly)
